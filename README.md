# Smart-Greenhouse-Monitoring-System-Based-on-IoT
Project: Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System Based on IoT Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer, IoT Sensors, Networking Devices Technologies: IoT, Wireless Networking, Automation, Sensor Integration....  
Project Overview:
Developed a smart greenhouse system using IoT-based automation to monitor and control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, CO₂ levels, and soil moisture. The system enables remote monitoring and automation to optimize plant growth using sensor-based data processing.

Key Features & Implementation:
✔ IoT-Based Monitoring: Configured sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, CO₂) for real-time data collection.
✔ Automated Control System: Integrated actuators (heaters, coolers, exhaust fans, and sprinklers) to respond to sensor data.
✔ Wireless Connectivity: Used Home Gateway & Wireless IoT Devices for remote control.
✔ Energy Efficiency: Implemented a solar power system to power the greenhouse autonomously.
✔ Security System: Installed a Smart Door and Trip Sensor Security System for controlled access.
